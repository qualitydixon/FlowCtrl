# FlowCtrl

Flow Ctrl is a simple utility app to assist with re-entry for events. It uses the popular <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&hl=en">Barcode Scanner</a> app to store a unique value (i.e a ticket or ID) and later can verify the existense of that value.

# TODO

- Trigger sound when barcode is found/not found
- Allow user to add their own data (csv) to check against
