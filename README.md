# FlowCtrl

Flow Ctrl provides a fast, efficient system for managing re-entry at any type of event. The functionality is simple. When someone leaves an event, the user can scan their ticket, id, or any other offical document with a barcode, and record their exit. When that person returns, the user scans the document again to verify.
